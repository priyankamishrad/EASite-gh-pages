  <p><strong><em>ORNL Internal Use Only</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: This document describes the current network enclaves and zones, as well as how these will get mapped into the new environment.  This is a working copy and should be reconciled against the cybersecurity program plan and information in NetReg.</p>

<p>Supercomputing
RAN
Ops
Open Research
DMZ</p>

<h1 id="operations-ops">Operations (OPS)</h1>
<p>The OPS enclave contains those systems (servers, workstations, printers, etc.) that provide business support for the ORNL research mission. These systems are generally funded by the SBMS management systems or within the support organizations of ORNL.</p>

<h2 id="klan-sub-protection-zone">KLAN (sub protection zone)</h2>
<p>The only systems allowed in the KLAN are ORNL.GOV domain controllers, administrative workstations and patching system.</p>

<h2 id="infra-dev-sub-protection-zone">Infra-Dev (sub protection zone)</h2>
<p>The infra-dev sub-enclave was created to separate our development active directory domain and its associated systems from our production system.</p>

<h2 id="srv-mgmt-sub-protection-zone">SRV-MGMT (sub protection zone)</h2>
<p>The SRV-MGMT zone has been setup for lights out monitoring of servers in DMZ, Operations (OPS) and Research Area Network (RAN).</p>

<h2 id="opsinfra-sub-protection-zone">OPS.INFRA (sub protection zone)</h2>
<p>The OPS.INFRA sub enclave contains those systems that are managed by IT and provide services to a wide range of RAN devices. Examples of systems that will reside in this sub-enclave include systems that will provide the following services: DNS, Patching, Configuration Mangement, SAP, Email, Web, SharePoint.</p>

<h2 id="moderate-with-enhanced-controls-mec-sub-protection-zone">Moderate with Enhanced Controls (M/EC) (sub protection zone)</h2>
<p>The Moderate with Enhanced Controls (M/EC) PZ contains those systems which process moderate information that ORNL has determined require additional (enhanced) controls to protect the information, including, UCNI, C/FGI-Mod, and NNPI.</p>

<h2 id="doe-site-office-sub-protection-zone">DOE Site Office (sub protection zone)</h2>
<p>The DOE PZ contains DOE owned devices only.</p>

<h2 id="opsservers-sub-protection-zone">OPS.SERVERS (sub protection zone)</h2>
<p>The OPS.SERVERS enclave contains systems that support operations but do not fit into the OPS.INFRA sub-enclave. This may be because the system is not managed by IT or because is supports only a portion of the ORNL community such as a division or directorate server. Systems may be placed in this sub-enclave because it is desired that the services they offer be separated from the OPS.INFRA sub-enclave.</p>

<h1 id="research-area-network-ran">Research Area Network (RAN)</h1>
<p>The RAN protection zone contains systems used to conduct research. This includes most of the general purpose desktop systems, servers, instruments, printers, etc. that are used to perform and document open research within ORNL, and systems used by researchers to conduct proprietary or closed research. The overall RAN system will operate at the Moderate level, which includes all categories of unclassified sensitive information (from Guide to Handling Sensitive Information Exhibit in SBMS) and DOES include ORNL email.</p>

<h2 id="raninfra-sub-protection-zone">RAN.INFRA (sub protection zone)</h2>
<p>The RAN.INFRA sub enclave contains those systems that are managed by IT and provide services to a wide range of RAN devices. Examples of systems that will reside in this sub-enclave include systems that will provide the following services:</p>

<p>DNS
Patching
Configuration Management
All services in RAN.INFRA will be a duplication of a service in OPS.INFRA. OPS.INFRA services will be duplicated to RAN.INFRA if the service is deemed necessary for RAN to function independent from OPS.
RAN.SERVERS (sub protection zone)
The RAN.SERVERS sub-enclave will be a general location for systems that provide support to ORNL.s research mission. These servers do not need to be managed by IT and may be managed by individual research projects.</p>

Open research is defined as fundamental research that is openly shared with a broad community, does not include applied or export controlled research, and does not collect or process any sensitive information (as defined by Sensitive Information Categories in SBMS). This protection zone may contain desktops and servers used by staff and collaborators. Note: Desktops in this PZ can not be used to access sensitive information including email. Desktops used to read email, record timekeeping in PALS, access SAP resources, or access other sensitive information must remain in the Research Area Network (RAN) PZ. Systems in the RAN PZ can be used to access resources in the Open Research PZ.</p>
