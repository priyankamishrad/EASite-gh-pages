# Enterprise Architecture Jekyll Site

------------------

### How To Contribute:

This is the git repositiority for the ORNL ITSD Enterprise Architecture Site hosted at http://purlhost.ornl.gov/. This site is generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with the [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) markdown language. 

Any changes made to the master branch will be pushed to the production site automatically using a [Gitlab CI Runner](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/). For this reason, the master branch has been protected so that only those with the Master role can commit changes to the master branch.

If you wish to get a change added to the site, you will need to create a merge request. There are two ways to do this, depending on your level of access to the project. If you have the developer role within the project, you can create a branch within the project, commit your changes to that branch, then create a merge request. If you do not have the developer role, you must first fork the project, make your changes to your fork, then create your merge request between projects.
