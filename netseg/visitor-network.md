# Visitor Network Overview

The Visitor Network is a service that ORNL provides for use with non-ORNL owned/managed devices.  It may be used by ORNL staff for their personally-owned devices and by on-site guests for their devices. This service provides basic Internet connectivity and access to very selected ORNL-internal services, such as printing.  

It is also acceptable to expose ORNL services to the Visitor Network as part of the testing and developing process, prior to opening those services to the world.  This permits testing and evaluation of services from non-ORNL managed devices while not incurring risks associated with broad Internet accessibility.  

# Authentication in the Visitor Network

The visitor network is a Level 0 environment, meaning that any credentials used in the visitor network are not managed by ORNL and are completely untrusted.  

# Visitor Network Services

There are no ORNL-managed systems which are in the Visitor Network.  Some ORNL networking equipment in the Core IT Services Enclave has network interfaces in the Visitor Network for providing services.
