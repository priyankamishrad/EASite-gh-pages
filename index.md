title: ORNL Enterprise Architecture Wiki

**Summary**: This wiki provides high level information about ORNL's Enterprise Architecture and links to additional information, including more detailed architecture artifacts.  At present, it is primarily being used to document the network and credential architecture as needed by the Multifactor Authentication (MFA) and Network Segmentation (NetSeg) projects.  Because this wiki contains security sensitive information, it is classified as OUO and all pages should be labeled as such.
